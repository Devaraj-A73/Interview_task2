# Interview_task2
    if we run the result_newpage it will ask user input and post method call the result.jsp file
    It defines the structure of an HTML page with a title.
    In the <body> section, it begins embedded Java code using <% ... %> tags.
    It retrieves a user input named "txtColumnCount" from a form submission.
    It checks if "columnCountStr" (the input value) is not empty and not null.
    If "columnCountStr" is valid, it tries to convert it to an integer called "columnCount."
    It generates an HTML table with a border attribute.
    It creates a header row in the table with column headers that go from 0 to the "columnCount," with two additional columns for "Sum" and "Avg."
    It generates rows in the table, where each row represents a number from 1 to "columnCount" and its multiples.
    It calculates the sum of the row values and the average of the row values and displays them in the last two columns of each row.
    If the input is not a valid integer, it catches an exception (NumberFormatException) and displays an error message asking the user to enter a valid number of columns.
    If "columnCountStr" is empty, it displays an error message asking the user to enter a valid number of columns.

In summary, this JSP file takes a user-provided number and generates an HTML table that displays a series of rows, each containing a sequence of numbers and their multiples. It also calculates and displays the sum and average of the numbers in the table. If the user provides invalid input or leaves the input empty, it provides error messages to guide them.
